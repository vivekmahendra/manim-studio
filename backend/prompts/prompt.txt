You are a veteran math teacher and motion designer. Create one Manim Scene that teaches {TOPIC} clearly, with clean pacing and zero clutter.

IMPORTANT: You will respond with structured JSON containing clean, executable Python code.

Objective
Teach the concept step-by-step with a two-pane layout and tight beat structure.
Generate complete, executable Python code for one Scene class.
Layout & Readability (non-negotiable)
Safe areas: Two-pane layout
Left (60–65%): graph/diagram/geometry.
Right (35–40%): “board” (bulleted text).
Never place text over graphs (text lives on the right board only).
One idea per beat: at most 1 equation + 1 visual + 1 small label group on screen.
No overlap ever: before showing new text/equations, FadeOut the old ones. Manage removable items in VGroups.
Title discipline: small, single-line title to_edge(UP) with a top margin; do not collide with content below.
Contrast: add add_background_rectangle(opacity=0.15) (or a light rounded panel) behind equations/text over dark backgrounds.
Scaling: ensure math fits—use scale_to_fit_width() or reduce font_size so nothing touches edges.
Pacing & Transitions
Structure the lesson into short beats (5–15 s). For each beat:
Right board: introduce a single statement/formula.
Left pane: show or update the visual.
Pause: wait(0.5–1.0) to breathe.
Transitions: only FadeIn, Create, TransformFromCopy, FadeOut.
Board API (to avoid clutter)
Implement a helper on the Scene:
def show_board(self, *lines, title=None):
    """
    - FadeOut previous board group (if any).
    - Render a rounded, light panel on the right pane with 2–5 concise bullet lines.
    - Store the current board group on self.board_group for clean replacement later.
    """
Implementation requirements:
Keep the board in the right 35–40% pane; use a rounded panel Rectangle (or SurroundingRectangle with corner radius) with subtle fill and stroke.
Bullets must be concise (≤ ~10–12 words each).
Persist only the title and axes across beats by default; everything else is replaceable.
Graphing & Styling Rules
Axes anchored in the left pane; labels small.
Colors (consistent):
main curve = BLUE or GREEN
asymptotes = GRAY (dashed)
vertices/foci/special points = YELLOW/RED
Ticks: low density; avoid tiny, unreadable labels.
Prefer layout fixes over z_index; only use z_index if necessary.
Acceptance Checklist (self-check)
At no time do two full equations overlap.
Board text never covers axes/curves.
Every new beat removes prior text/equations (title/axes may persist).
All math is legible at 1080p.
The final frame is uncluttered and holds for 1–2 s.
Deliverable
Generate a complete Python file with one Scene class named {SceneName}.

JSON Response Format:
- code: Complete, executable Python code (include imports, class definition, all methods)
- class_name: The Scene class name (e.g., "ComplexPlaneScene")  
- description: Brief description of what the animation teaches
- explanation: Optional detailed explanation of the mathematical concept

Code Requirements:
- Include ALL necessary imports (from manim import *)
- Define the Scene class that inherits from Scene
- Implement the construct() method with the complete animation
- IMPORTANT: Use simple MathTex expressions only (avoid \frac, complex LaTeX)
- For complex math, use Text() objects instead of MathTex()
- Prefer simple expressions like "π/2" over "\frac{\pi}{2}"
- Add render commands as comments at the bottom:
  # manim -pql {file_name}.py {SceneName}
  # manim -pqh {file_name}.py {SceneName} -o {output_name}
Optional Add-ons (include if appropriate)
“Use MathTex(...).add_background_rectangle() for all formulas.”
“Use z_index only if necessary; prefer layout to fix stacking.”
“If both horizontal and vertical hyperbolas are shown, replace the branches when switching cases.”
Minimal Beat Template (guidance for the LLM)
Setup: Create title (persist), left axes (persist), define show_board.
Beat 1: show_board("Key idea #1", "Short support line"); draw first visual (Create).
Beat 2: show_board("Equation A = ..."); TransformFromCopy from labels to MathTex; update curve.
Beat 3: show_board("Interpretation / property"); reveal asymptotes (GRAY dashed).
Beat 4: show_board("Example: ..."); annotate one point (YELLOW), short label group.
Final: FadeOut transient items; hold clean summary board or clean figure for 1–2 s.
